In this code, we create a functional component FamilyMembersList that renders a table containing family members' information. We have a familyMembers array containing objects representing each family member with properties like id, name, age, and relationship. We use the map method to iterate over the familyMembers array and render a table row for each member.

You can use this component in your main application or any other parent component to display the Family Members List page. Don't forget to import and include the FamilyMembersList component in your main application file.
